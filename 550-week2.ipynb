    "a) Word count vector can be helpful in a spam model. If we are building a model to detect spam, we would use multiple emails as reference. If certain keywords are continuously seen in emails we assume to be spam, the model can then start filtering emails as being spam based on the presence of these keywords. For example, if we input thousands of spam emails and most of them include the word \"prince\", the model then can learn that the presence of the word \"prince\" might entail a future email to be spam.\n",
    "b) Part of speech tag might be helpful for a program that grammatically checks text. If the program notes that a sentence is lacking the presence of \"NN\" (noun), it could flag that sentence as being grammatically incorrect. \n",
    "c) Term frequency-inverse document frequency could be used to look at sentiment. If a survery were to be sent out to a large portion of the poulation, to get their viewpoint on a concept, we could use this to see what the sentiment tends to be. If the survery were regarding a movie, and the most frequent word was \"good\", then we could understand that the general consensus towards the movie is positive. "
